// Version identifies the distsql protocol version.
//
// This version is separate from the main CockroachDB version numbering; it is
// only changed when the distsql API changes.
//
// The planner populates the version in SetupFlowRequest.
// A server only accepts requests with versions in the range MinAcceptedVersion
// to Version.
//
// Is is possible used to provide a "window" of compatibility when new features are
// added. Example:
//   - we start with Version=1; distsql servers with version 1 only accept
//     requests with version 1.
//   - a new distsql feature is added; Version is bumped to 2. The
//     planner does not yet use this feature by default; it still issues
//     requests with version 1.
//   - MinAcceptedVersion is still 1, i.e. servers with version 2
//     accept both versions 1 and 2.
//   - after an upgrade cycle, we can enable the feature in the planner,
//     requiring version 2.
//   - at some later point, we can choose to deprecate version 1 and have
//     servers only accept versions >= 2 (by setting
//     MinAcceptedVersion to 2).
