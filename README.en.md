### Environment Preparation

1. Download and extract [the CMake installation package](https://cmake.org/download/).

   ```Bash
   tar -C /usr/local/ -xvf cmake-3.23.4-linux-x86_64.tar.gz
   mv /usr/local/cmake-3.23.4-linux-x86_64 /usr/local/cmake
   ```

2. Download and extract [the Go installation package](https://golang.google.cn/dl/).

   ```Bash
   tar -C /usr/local -xvf go1.22.5.linux-amd64.tar.gz
   ```

3. Create a directory for the project.

   ```Bash
   mkdir -p /home/go/src/gitee.com
   ```

4. Set environment variables for Go and CMake.

   - Individual users: Modify the `~/.bashrc` file.

   - System-wide settings (root permissions needed): Modify the `/etc/profile` file.

      ```Bash
      export GOROOT=/usr/local/go
      export GOPATH=/home/go      # here using /home/go as an example
      export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/go/bin:/usr/local/cmake/bin
      ```

5. Apply the environment variable settings:

   - Individual users:

      ```Shell
      source ~/.bashrc                           
      ```

   - System-wide settings:

      ```Shell
      source /etc/profile                           
      ```

### Downloading Code

Download the code from the [KWDB code repository](https://gitee.com/kwdb/kwdb) and store it in the directory declared by `GOPATH`.

- Use `git` commands:

   ```Bash
   git clone https://gitee.com/kwdb/kwdb.git /home/go/src/gitee.com/kwbasedb # Do not modify src/gitee.com/kwbasedb in the directory path.
   cd /home/go/src/gitee.com/kwbasedb
   git submodule update --init  # For the first-time code pull
   git submodule update --remote
   ```

- Download the code archive and extract it to the specified directory.

### Building and Installing

1. Create and change to the build directory in the project directory.

   ```Bash
   cd /home/go/src/gitee.com/kwbasedb
   mkdir build && cd build
   ```

2. Run the CMake command.

   ```Bash
   cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=[Release | Debug ]
   ```

   `CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE`: the build type. The default is `Debug`. Optional values include `Debug` and `Release`, with the initial letter capitalized.

3. Disable Go modules.

   1. Set the environment variable.

      - Individual users: Modify the `~/.bashrc` file.

      - System-wide settings (requires root permissions): Modify the `/etc/profile` file.

         ```Shell
         export GO111MODULE=off         
         ```

   2. Apply the environment variable settings:

      - Individual users:

        ```Shell
        source ~/.bashrc         
        ```

      - System-wide settings:

        ```Shell
        source /etc/profile 
        ```

4. Compile and install the project.

   > **Note:**
   > If there is an error due to legacy protobuf autogenerated files during code compilation, use `make clean` to clean the build directory.

   ```Shell
   make      
   make install      
   ```

   The file list after successful compilation and installation is as follows:

   ```Plain
   /home/go/src/gitee.com/kwbasedb
   ├── install
   │   ├── bin
   │   │   ├── err_inject.sh
   │   │   ├── query_kwbase_status.sh
   │   │   ├── query_status.sh
   │   │   ├── setup_cert_file.sh
   │   │   ├── utils.sh
   │   │   └── kwbase
   │   └── lib
   │       ├── libcommon.so
   │       └── libkwdbts2.so
   ```

5. (Optional) In the directory where the `kwbase` script is located, check the database version to verify if the installation is successful.

   ```Bash
   ./kwbase version
   ```

   Example output:

   ```Plain
   KaiwuDB Version:  V2.0.3.2_RC3-3-gfe5eeb853e-dirty
   Build Time:       2024/07/19 06:24:00
   Distribution:
   Platform:         linux amd64 (x86_64-linux-gnu)
   Go Version:       go1.22.5
   C Compiler:       gcc 11.4.0
   Build SHA-1:      fe5eeb853e0884a963fd43b380a0b0057f88fb19
   ```

### Starting the Database

1. Switch to the directory where the `kwbase` script is located.

   ```Bash
   cd /home/go/src/gitee.com/kwbasedb/install/bin
   ```

2. Set the search path for shared libraries.

   ```Bash
   export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=../lib
   ```

3. Start the database.

   ```Bash
   ./kwbase start-single-node --insecure --listen-addr=:26257 --background
   ```

4. After the database starts, it can be connected and used via the KaiwuDB Developer Center or connectors like KaiwuDB JDBC driver.
